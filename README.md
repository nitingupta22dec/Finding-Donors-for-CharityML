# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

In this project, I have applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I have first explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I've applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I have then evaluated several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and considered which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I have optimized the model that I selected and present it as the solution to CharityML. Finally, I have explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.


### In this project, I've used the following software and Python libraries:
- Python
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (v0.17)
- matplotlib
